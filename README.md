# SoftUni-Python

My journey through the SoftUni Python Professional Program.
These are the raw files that I created through all the modules.
These are non edited since it's nice to see the improvement from the Basics to the End in terms of clean code, naming things, etc...
It was a fun journey and I uploaded these mostly because I don't want to lose them if something happens and maybe for future nostalgia when I go back to them after a couple years.
