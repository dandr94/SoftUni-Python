    <p>My journey through the SoftUni Python Professional Program.</p>

### Files
These are the raw files that I created through all the modules.
These are non edited since it's nice to see the improvement from the Basics to the End in terms of clean code, naming things, etc...
It was a fun journey and I uploaded these mostly because I don't want to lose them if something happens and maybe for future nostalgia when I go back to them after a couple of years.
`Important: these files are NOT all the tasks that were given to solve. Some of them are missing and some of them don't even get the maximum points in Judge.`
